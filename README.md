# Challenge-1-UTABootcamp
Challenge 1 For UTA Bootcamp (Refactoring and Accessibility)

## Description
This project is a practice in refactoring existing code by improving its accessibility and reworking the CSS to make it more efficient. The HTML has been edited to include semantic elements, improving usage for users who require assitive technologies. Even with all the changes to the HTML and CSS, the website has not been changed externally and still functions and looks the same as it did before beginning this project. In the process of reaching the present code however, I messed with the code too much and throw various elements of the page in disarray, but through that, it has allowed me to practice problem-solving and learn how to backtrack and correct my mistakes along with proper CSS practices such as choosing the correct selectors and making sure my file follows proper etiquette with how each line of code is ordered.
